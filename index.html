EQUITIES may be enjoying a bull run but the government-bond market has turned sour. Having bottomed at 1.67% in September, the yield on the ten-year Treasury bond has risen to 2.38%, with the sell-off accelerating in the past two weeks.
A rise in yields from what were very low levels, in historical terms, is not that surprising. The economic data have been better than expected since the start of the year, particularly in America, calming fears of a global recession. A torrent of central-bank loans to euro-zone banks and Greece’s debt-restructuring deal have made investors less nervous about a break-up of the euro, removing the appeal of Treasury bonds as a haven.

But if monetary policy were systematically too tight, inflation should have fallen much further than it has; instead, both actual and (survey-based) expected inflation have been surprisingly stable, and higher than forecast by outfits like the IMF and the Fed who assign a relatively large weight to the output gap in the determination of inflation. The stability of inflation may be down to well-anchored inflation expectations, but this is ex-post reasoning; it’s not an unambiguously superior explanation than reduced potential.I disagree. First, the literature suggests that we should not expect accelerating disinflation in the presence of large output gaps. This is not based on an ex-post assessment that expectations are well anchored but on the ex-ante observation that wages and prices display substantial downward nominal rigidity.

IN THE search for the villain behind the global financial crisis, some have pointed to inequality as a culprit. In his 2010 book “Fault Lines”, Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago argued that inequality was a cause of the crisis, and that the American government served as a willing accomplice. From the early 1980s the wages of working Americans with little or no university education fell ever farther behind those with university qualifications, he pointed out. Under pressure to respond to the problem of stagnating incomes, successive presidents and Congresses opened a flood of mortgage credit.
In 1992 the government reduced capital requirements at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two huge sources of housing finance. In the 1990s the Federal Housing Administration expanded its loan ...</div>

IN THE search for the villain behind the global financial crisis, some have pointed to inequality as a culprit. In his 2010 book “Fault Lines”, Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago argued that inequality was a cause of the crisis, and that the American government served as a willing accomplice. From the early 1980s the wages of working Americans with little or no university education fell ever farther behind those with university qualifications, he pointed out. Under pressure to respond to the problem of stagnating incomes, successive presidents and Congresses opened a flood of mortgage credit.
In 1992 the government reduced capital requirements at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two huge sources of housing finance. In the 1990s the Federal Housing Administration expanded its loan ...<div class="og_rss_groups"></div>

THERE are tantalising signs of good news in the world economy. In America firms are hiring more and consumers are spending more. The euro zone’s recession is proving milder than expected. Greece’s debt restructuring, the first sovereign default in a developed economy for 60 years, has passed off without a hitch. Cheered by the signs of recovery, and relieved that disaster has been avoided (particularly in Europe, which towards the end of last year seemed on the brink of a calamity of Lehman-like magnitude), financial markets have been climbing steadily higher.

  UNDER a thatched roof, lit by a full, yellow moon, Shiv Kumari explains how she and her five children survive. She is a widow, 30 years old, living in a home made of packed mud. She works the nearby fields, draws a small pension, some food rations and gets a few days of paid labour each month from a rural make-work scheme. Semra village, made up of 70 households, most of them dalit, or lowest-caste, is not India’s poorest. It has no grid electricity, but for the past five years a couple of solar-powered street lamps have cast puddles of light each evening. It has no sewers or piped water, so villagers clank buckets at the village pump. Wood smoke from cooking fires envelops the homes each evening. Despite some government help Ms Kumari, and hundreds of millions of other Indians, remain in poverty—roughly on a par with the poorest of Africans. Standard measures, such as the rate of child malnutrition (around two-fifths of Indian infants are stunted by hunger) suggest that while economic growth brings some broad benefits, it is coming slowly and unequally. Discerning how and where those gains are being made, however, is made easier by India’s tradition of conducting an efficient census.

We know recoveries are weaker after financial crises but they are still supposed to be recoveries, i.e. the output gap should close, albeit slowly.The second puzzle: unemployment is falling more quickly than the GDP data can explain.

TEN years ago Brazil still carried the taint of the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s and of Argentina’s default in 2001. Brazilian government bonds were rated as junk and its debt yielded more than 10%. But Brazil did not default, and its bonds were promoted to investment-grade status in 2008.
The debt of its corporate sector has also become much more appealing to international investors. When Petrobras, the national oil company, raised ten-year money in 2003, it paid 9.1%; now its bonds yield less than 5%. The company is rated only BBB (towards the bottom end of the investment-grade spectrum) by Standard &amp; Poor’s and Fitch, two ratings agencies. But its offer of $7 billion of bonds attracted $25 billion-worth of bids last month.

Encouragingly, job gains for December and January were revised upward, by 20,000 and 41,000, respectively. It was the second upward revision for the December payroll total, which was also nudged upward in the January release. Upward revisions have been quite common during the recovery, in fact—a significant change from the norm during the period of heavy recession job loss.The chart at right gives a sense of the magnitude of the error in initial estimates over the course of the downturn (data here). Both lines show the cumulative changes in employment from June of 2009—the final month of the recession. The dark blue line shows the total according to the first reported estimates and the light blue line shows the total according to the data after all revisions. Between the beginning of the recession and its end, initial releases underreported employment loss by roughly 1m jobs. Someone watching only the headline-generating first estimate would have a too-optimistic sense of the state of the job market. In recovery the trend has swung sharply in the other direction. Initial estimates have underreported job gains since the end of the recession to the tune of almost 1m. Cumulatively, the revised data have indicated a labour market that fell ...</div>
