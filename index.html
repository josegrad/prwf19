According to the latest assessment by the United Nations, the region has already reached the Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015 (with 1990 as the baseline). The proportion of people living on less than $1.25 a day fell from 50% in 1990 to 22% in 2009. In terms of warm bodies, this means a reduction from 1.57 billion people to 871m. The region has also been an "early achiever" on other targets such as the education of girls and reducing the spread of HIV and tuberculosis. Asia is also close to halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water. But the region as a whole has been slow to improve basic sanitation and maternal health care. Over 3m children under-five died in 2010. Thousands of women die each year in labour, which is perhaps unsurprising as some 22m women give birth without a trained health professional present.

FAILURE IN THE financial crisis had many fathers. There were failures of regulators, bankers, shareholders, borrowers and economists. But two in particular were closely tied to the way financial innovations work. One was a failure of plumbing—the infrastructure of the markets and the back offices of financial firms. The other was a failure of the imagination.
Infrastructure often lags when an innovation takes off. Remember how markets move over time from being customised to becoming more standardised. When products are standardised and demand is high, finance’s manufacturing, sales and distribution channels can pump out a vast supply. The frightening growth of over-the-counter derivatives markets attests to that (see chart 6).

This had been agreed in principle at a European summit in July last year. But political turmoil in Greece, hesitation in the euro zone—and an ever-worsening fiscal hole caused by an ever-deepening recession—made the deal elusive for months. It was concluded before dawn this morning after finance ministers, the European Central Bank and representatives of private creditors squeezed the numbers to produce a package that was deemed both politically acceptable to creditors and provided Greece with something it reckoned to be sustainable. As explained in my earlier post, the negotiators were working within self-imposed constraints. According to the final statement, the deal is expected to bring down Greece’s debt ratio to 120.5% of GDP in 2020, while requiring no more than €130 billion ($173 billion) in additional finance in the coming two years. To square the circle, ministers have applied the file to several aspects. - Private creditors have accepted a haircut of 53.5% of the nominal value of Greek bonds they hold, plus a reduction in the coupon for new bonds, starting at 2% and rising to 4.3% from 2020.

Since Mr Kling didn't, I'll do it for him.The NAIRU, as Mr Kling notes, is the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. It corresponds to maximum structural employment; the economy can't sustain a higher level of employment than this without structural reform of some kind. Why is it called the non-accelerating inflation rate? Well, were the government to try to raise employment above that level, fiscally or monetarily, inflation would accelerate.

That must surely have boosted the number of the world’s poor (especially since food inflation hits the poor hardest)—right? Wrong. New estimates of the numbers of the world’s poor by the World Bank’s Development Research Group show that for the first time ever, poverty—defined as the number and share of people living below $1.25 a day (at 2005 prices)—fell in every region of the world in 2005-08. Half the long-term decline is attributable to China, which has taken 660m people out of poverty since the early 1980s. But the main contribution to the recent turnaround is Africa. Its poverty headcount rose at every three-year interval between 1981 and 2005, the only continent where this happened. But in 2008, it fell by 12m, or five percentage points to 47%—the first time less than half of Africans have been below the poverty line. The bank also has partial estimates for 2010. These show global poverty that year was half its 1990 level, implying the long-term rate of poverty reduction—slightly over one percentage point a year—continued unabated in 2008-10, despite the dual crisis.

For example, in 1970s Mali, 37% of children born did not reach their fifth birthday. In 2010, that rate stood at a markedly lower 18%. Getting from there to the levels seen in the rich world is harder. One of the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals requires that by 2015, developing countries should reduce their under-five mortality rate to one-third of where it stood in 1990.

While China, with 13% of the world's 636m children under five, is on course to meet the goal by 2015, it will be among only an additional 23 countries to do so, leaving 101 countries set to miss the target.

First, Apple has hired the Fair Labor Association to investigate Foxconn's factories. Second, Foxconn has raised wages. Third, an ABC documentary team visited Foxconn's factories and found mostly a lot of perfectly natural boredom, rather than dangerous working conditions per se. (Foxconn was aware of the visit in advance, and obviously would have ensured everything was scrubbed for the camera and that only compliant workers were around.) And finally, there's tons of evidence that the Chinese workers are very happy to have Foxconn jobs. They're better-paid than life in the village, they're often viewed as starter jobs for young people who are planning to move on to something more substantial later on, and, as one letter writer notes, working at Foxconn was a lot better for his aunt than her prior job as a village prostitute.Mr Ozimek concludes two things. The first is an argument about the primacy of rising productivity, rather than labour safety regulations, in improving working conditions.

A YEAR after the start of the Arab spring, no government in the Middle East has attempted serious economic reform even though it is obvious both that economies are distorted and that discontent over living standards has played a big part in the uprisings. The main reaction by governments has been to buy off further protests by increasing public spending. Saudi Arabia boosted government spending by over 50% between 2008 and 2011.
Although higher oil prices have been enough to finance these rises, much of the extra spending has gone into public-sector wages and consumer subsidies. Food and fuel subsidies are often huge: over 10% of GDP in Egypt. In the region as a whole, fuel subsidies rose from 2.3% of GDP in 2009 to 3.2% in 2011.

THEY barely dare say it, but the doctors are strangely confident: after a long illness, the euro may be recovering. This week’s all-night surgery by finance ministers to excise a festering lump of Greek debt went better than expected. “We have put in place almost all of the elements we need to make the crisis gradually go away,” says one. “We may be beyond the acute phase, and could be making the transition to normalisation.” It is the optimism of despair: the patient has not died, so must be improving.
Many are sceptical. But consider the evidence. Greece may now stabilise. It must meet conditions to get its money and will endure pain for years. But the risk of chaotic default and exit from the euro has receded. Private creditors have taken a big loss, yet the markets are ...</div>

                    Natural resources are not really a curse at all        
        

DALLAS is in confident mood. The city, one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in America, is investing around $11 billion in improving its road, rail and air links. The Perot Museum of Nature &amp; Science is being built downtown along with a new park that will cover the Woodall Rodgers expressway.
  
    
    
    
  
It clearly helps the local economy that Texas is abundant in both oil and shale gas, even if the price of the latter is rather lower than producers would like. But is betting on energy a good idea? After all, the state went though a nasty bust in the mid-1980s when the oil price collapsed.

      	<div class="entry_summary">THE Bank of Japan surprised markets on Tuesday by announcing its intention to add ¥10 trillion to its purchases of government debt in an effort to hit a newly established near-term inflation target of 1%. The Japanese economy has suffered from weak growth and deflation for years, but the immediate context of the decision was a rotten fourth-quarter output number. In the final three months of 2011, GDP shrank at a 2.3% annual pace, significantly worse than expected. The Bank's action is particularly interesting given the dynamics of international trade. Japan's export performance in 2011 was a dismal one. The substantial supply-chain disruptions associated with last year's seismic and nuclear disasters were obviously a big part of that. But the deterioration in Japan's trade balance is about more than just a one-off catastrophe. Exports should have been mostly back on track by the end of 2011, but sales abroad nonetheless suffered—including those of automobiles, at a time when car producers from America to Britain to Europe are reporting good figures. And indeed, Japanese net trade has been moving toward a deficit for most of the past half decade, as the chart at right indicates.
