But what else for the coming year? My hope in January was that the euro zone would get its act together and that peace might break out between Israelis and Palestinians—but it was the faintest of hopes and most definitely not a prediction.

  THE story of Schrödinger's cat illustrates a nice finding of particle physics: you cannot measure something without changing its outcome. Curiously enough, that is true of a lot of social policy too. Take poverty. Until the late Victorian period, poverty in Britain was well documented–read almost any Dickens novel. But it wasn't well measured. That meant that it tended to be seen in individual terms: this person is poor for that reason. It was only in the 1890s, when social researchers such as Charles Booth and Seebohm Rowntree started knocking on doors and actually counting poor people, that Victorian Britain got a sense of the sheer amount of poverty in their midst. That made the rise of the welfare state, which really began with old age pensions in 1909, slightly more inevitable.All of which is a long way of saying that measuring poverty matters. This is something that Iain Duncan Smith, the welfare secretary, is well aware of. Yesterday, he gave a speech arguing that poverty "simply cannot be captured by assessing whether their household has more or less than 60% of the average income." He wants the measure to be broader–and not primarily about income. We've published a story on the proposed change here. Mr Duncan Smith's argument that the current poverty line isn't an effective measure. But his real motivation for wanting to ...</div>

IT IS easy to understand why tying foreign aid to exports appeals to rich-world politicians. It seems to kill so many birds with one stone: international do-goodery; jobs and profits at home; perhaps, as a consequence, corporate donations for your party. It is also easy to see why the marriage will always be fraught. The exporters’ interests—to maximise profits—are in direct competition with the interests of the aid recipients. It is more than likely that this tension will be reflected not just in difficult negotiations with the exporters and their customers but in fierce turf battles between the various government ...</div>

                    Countries’ fiscal policies are becoming more similar        
        





ALL around the developed world politicians are struggling to figure out the best way of balancing their budgets, at least over the medium term. But is it easier to get spending down or taxes up?
The charts show the recent record on tax and spending for America, the euro zone and the OECD as a whole. The spending numbers are slightly more variable and consistently higher than the tax take. Both tax and spending are subject to cyclical effects. Spending has a cyclical component because of the cost of unemployment benefit as well as the use of deliberate Keynesian stimulus. On the tax side revenue from corporate profits and capital gains falls sharply during downturns, although consumption taxes are more stable.
What is striking is the narrow range within which the tax take has moved. Since 1994 euro-zone taxes have not been below 44.6% or above 46.6% of GDP. In America the total tax take has been between 30% ...</div>

                    The government sets out to redefine what it means to be poor        
        





WHEN Seebohm Rowntree, a chocolate-maker and pioneering social researcher, began measuring poverty in York in 1899, he worked out the minimum needed to buy enough food for “physical efficiency”. In 1935, when he repeated the study, Rowntree added allowances for cigarettes, newspapers and a holiday. By 1951 he concluded that poverty was on its way towards being eradicated, with only pockets among the elderly left, and stopped counting.
Few now experience the raw penury of Rowntree’s day. But measuring poverty remains an obsession. In its dying days the last Labour government passed a law committing its successors to reduce child poverty. That is causing trouble for the present lot. Under the law, poverty is defined primarily in relative terms: families with less than 60% of the median income are considered to be poor.

                    The perverse effects of local aid        
        





CHANNELLING development aid directly to local decision-makers sounds like a good plan. Empowering local groups like community clubs and school boards means decisions can reflect actual needs on the ground. It should mean fewer bureaucratic hands in the pot, too. But a new report by two World Bank economists warns against relying on decisions made at the most local level of government. Entrenched elites, bribery and fraud are as much of a problem in village life as they are in big emerging-market bureaucracies.
That warning will come as a shock to many. The idea that management of natural resources and services like health and education might be improved if locally controlled has deep roots in development, say Ghazala Mansuri and Vijayendra Rao, the report’s authors. Where local participation does not happen organically, in groups that represent parents, women or workers, development aid often tries to nudge such efforts ...</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">THROUGHOUT the recovery, I have used movements in inflation expectations as a gauge for the strength of the economy. I have done so for a few reasons. First, higher inflation is a healthy thing in a recovery like the current one, amid broad deleveraging and when interest rates are stuck near zero. They facilitate adjustment amid nominal rigidities, the most important of which is the inability of the central bank's policy rate to fall below zero: higher inflation means a more negative, and more stimulative, real interest rate. And second, higher inflation is a reasonable approximation for higher demand. Expectations of rising prices are indicative of expectations for more demand, more spending, and ultimately more production and hiring. Medium-run inflation expectations, as measured by 2-year and 5-year breakeven rates between garden-variety Treasury securities and inflation-protected Treasuries, have been a reliable indicator of the direction of recovery.And so I have become a little worried about America's economy. Inflation expectations sank in late spring, stabilised and ticked upward over the summer as Europeans acted to prevent a euro-zone meltdown, then rose rapidly in September when the Federal Reserve unveiled a new policy framework which included ongoing asset purchases.

Organising and funding deposit guarantee schemes can remain a national responsibility, with comparable effectiveness.” While Mr Draghi’s comments chime with the thinking of officials in Brussels, it was the most explicit acknowledgment yet that plans for a single deposit guarantee scheme, already shelved, may not be revived.
