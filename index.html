        <p>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA has already received much praise for his recent victories on the Pacific front. "Obama gets an A on Asia," tweeted Keith Urbahn, the chief of staff to  Donald Rumsfeld, a former Defence Secretary. America's diplomatic blitz, timed to correspond with the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO summit in Hawaii, was "as decisive a diplomatic victory as anyone is likely to see," wrote Walter Russell Mead, a centrist foreign policy scholar. (Our correspondents have been more sceptical—as has China.) Here's Mr Mead's summary of the administration's main accomplishments: The US is moving forces to Australia, Australia is selling uranium to India, Japan is stepping up military actions and coordinating more closely with the Philippines and Vietnam in the South China Sea, Myanmar is slipping out of China’s column and seeking to reintegrate itself into the region, Indonesia and the Philippines are deepening military ties with the the US: and all that in just one week. If that wasn’t enough, a critical mass of the region’s countries have agreed to work out a new trade group that does not include China, while the US, to applause, has proposed that China’s territorial disputes with its neighbors be settled at a forum like the East Asia Summit — rather than in the bilateral talks with its smaller, weaker neighbors that China prefers.This is all important stuff.

PREPARE for some bad news. The prime minister, David Cameron, told an audience of business leaders on November 21st that shrinking the budget deficit was “proving harder than anyone envisaged.” His comments laid the ground for the chancellor, George Osborne, who makes his autumn statement on the economy and public finances on November 29th. The chancellor’s message is likely to be grim: a downgrade to official growth forecasts for next year and beyond seems certain. The coalition government’s hopes of eliminating the “structural” part of the deficit (the bit that cannot be blamed on temporary slack in the economy) and of capping public debt by the end of the current parliament are in serious doubt.
Bond markets are likely to be forgiving, given the scale of troubles elsewhere. ...</p>

EVEN as the euro zone hurtles towards a crash, most people are assuming that, in the end, European leaders will do whatever it takes to save the single currency. That is because the consequences of the euro’s destruction are so catastrophic that no sensible policymaker could stand by and let it happen.
A euro break-up would cause a global bust worse even than the one in 2008-09. The world’s most financially integrated region would be ripped apart by defaults, bank failures and the imposition of capital controls (see article). The euro zone could shatter into different pieces, or a large block in the north and a fragmented south. Amid the recriminations and broken treaties after the failure of the European Union’s biggest economic project, wild currency swings between those ...</p>

        <p>This post has been updated.THE bad news out of Europe is coming fast and thick now. Markets were still digesting news of Spain's terrible bond auction yesterday, in which the yield on its 3-month debt more than doubled, from 2.3% to over 5%. That was but an appetizer, however; in an auction of 10-year debt today, Germany failed to place some 40% of the issuance. The lack of appetite for German debt has come as a shock to many, and the language being used to describe matters is increasingly apocalyptic. "It is a complete and utter disaster", Reuters has one strategist saying. On the secondary market, German bond yields have finally joined those of its neighbours on their upward march. The German 10-year yield is up sharply today (update: this initially read that the 10-year yield was up 7 percentage points on the day; in fact it was up 7%), and back above 2%. It still has a way to go to catch France and Austria (approaching 4%), Belgium (over 5%), and Spain and Italy (back near 7%).Trouble at big European banks is growing; the euro-zone banking system is increasingly reliant on the European Central Bank for funding. The prospect of bank failures is a troubling one given the fiscal strain on European sovereigns; no one wants to find itself in Ireland's position, squarely in bond vigilantes' crosshairs having assumed the obligations of sinking banks.

        <p>THINGS need to get worse before they can get better. That is the view of many commentators on the euro zone crisis, who think that only when complete catastrophe seems imminent, will European political leaders take the necessary action. (They don't always agree on what that action might be but it is usually some combination of unlimited bond purchases by the European Central Bank and moves towards fiscal union.)Richard McGuire, the fixed income strategist at Rabobank, is very much in that camp. He argues that most of the daily headlines, such as changes in Greek and Italian governments, don't matter. The fundamental problem is one currency and 17 separate fiscal authorities; until that situation is resolved, there will be no solution. Austerity policies won't work.But Mr McGuire has also figured out what the next stage of the crisis will mean for investors. Up until now, the obvious strategy has been to buy German government bonds and sell just about everything else, on the grounds that, if the euro zone does break up, you want your money to be in Deutsche Marks. But if European politicians do unveil a rescue plan, that will either mean the core countries assuming the burden of eurozone debt, or it will mean that long-term inflation risks will have risen.At that stage, investors will pile out of long-term German government debt and into the short-term debt of countries like ...</p>

        <p>ON NOVEMBER 21st Hungary formally asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for financial support, for the second time in three years. The decision to return to the global lender of last resort appears to signal that the government has abandoned its 18-month experiment in what it has variously called a “struggle for economic independence” (when addressing certain domestic audiences) or, before a broader public, “unorthodox economic policy”.
György Matolcsy, the finance minister, told Parliament that in returning to the IMF, the country was seeking a “safety net” utterly unlike the standby loan Hungary walked away from last spring. “The situation is completely different,” he said, “because we are starting discussions about a financial safety net from which we don’t want to draw down a single penny.” That suggested he was seeking a loan without too many conditions attached. However, such favourable terms may not be forthcoming. The IMF offers loans with few strings attached to countries with sound finances that are in temporary difficulties. But few see Hungary’s troubles in such a benign light.
At its heart, Mr Matolcsy’s unorthodox economic policy was a gamble that the government could stimulate domestic and export demand enough to restore economic growth before the resulting deficits caught up with it. When Hungary walked away from the IMF in spring 2010, it was because ...</p>

        <p>ANOTHER bad day for the markets. Investors seem to have taken little heart from the sweeping victory of the Popular Party in Spain, focusing instead on the failure of the US super-committee to agree on a deal and rather gloomy statement on the global economy from Chinese vice premier Wang Qishan.In the euro zone, investors may be suffering from what Lombard Street Research neatly describes as "crisis solution fatigue". An FT story suggested a plan for eurobonds may be issued this week; last week, the market was pinning its hopes on the ECB and the IMF and it was long ago that the European Financial Stability Facility was the rescue vehicle of choice.The idea behind eurobonds is to allow the weaker countries to benefit from the financial strength of the likes of Germany and the Netherlands. After all, at the aggregate level, eurozone government indebtedness is no worse than that of the US. But the quid pro quo for such a deal is some kind of central control over the fiscal policies of euro zone governments.As Lombard remarkswe remain a long way from any kind of comprehensive solution to Europe’s crisis. To start, the most draconian form of Eurobond - probably the one that would appeal most to the Germans who have to fund it, will face stiff opposition everywhere else. Many countries will oppose the loss of sovereignty this scheme seeks to impose on them. Sure, there are ...</p>

        <p>IN MY print column this week I look at the political implications of Britain's rising youth unemployment:“WE are all in this together,” promises David Cameron’s government,  as it tries to fix shattered public finances and set Britain on a path  of sustainable growth. It matters that voters should believe this. Not because the claim  will soothe those suffering most from spending cuts or lost employment.  Instead, a sense of fairness is vital to the broad mass of voters who  keep their jobs in even nasty recessions, and whose households will  survive this crisis. Fairness gives the majority permission to support  policies needed to fix the mess, but which will impose real pain on  some.That is why it spelled danger for the government when new figures  were released on November 16th, showing that youth unemployment had  crossed the one million mark: its highest level in a generation. Several  caveats surround that number. Youth unemployment has been rising in  Britain since before the credit crunch. Within the headline total for  jobless 16- to 24-year-olds, more than a quarter are students looking  for part-time work. Britain’s youth unemployment rate is 21.9%—far below  countries like Spain. The overall unemployment rate of 8.3% looks  better because companies are hunkering down and retaining staff in the  hope of a recovery. This happens when economies slump: adults are ...</p>

IN 1964 LADYBIRD BOOKS, a British publishing company, launched a series of small picture books to help young children learn to read. They featured Peter and Jane, their dog, their house, their toys and the rest of their little world. Their dad went out to work and their mum stayed at home and looked after Peter and Jane. By the late 1970s, after a couple of updates, their world had changed slightly: dad did more things around the house and Jane was wearing jeans rather than skirts. But she still spent a lot of her time at home playing with her doll or helping mum. Peter preferred to be out and about with dad.
The books are still available, but their charm is now of the vintage variety. When they were first published, families in most industrial countries were just like Peter’s and Jane’s. In ...</p>

        <p>  THE leaders of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) gather for their 19th summit on the Indonesian island of Bali this week. It seems to be a popular club now; any country with even a remote interest in the Asia-Pacific region wants to join, or at least sit in. A bewildering array of what they like to call “ASEAN-centric” summits and organisations have been created to accommodate the newcomers, from India to New Zealand, from China to Russia.   Thus a modern ASEAN summit has become a series of summits and bilateral meetings, scheduled for consecutive days. The climax this year will be the appearance of President Barack Obama himself to signal America’s official accession to the East Asia Summit, a relatively new grouping of the ASEAN-ten, plus eight others. More than ever, it all heralds a feeling that this really will be the Asian century. Mr Obama himself said it again again, Wednesday. However, the ASEAN agenda this year will focus not so much on proud New Asia, but probably more on floundering Old Europe. As at the G20 meeting in France recently, the euro crisis has forced its way onto the agenda. The ASEAN-related economic discussions, in particular, could well focus on what the Asian-Pacific economies can do to avoid contagion from the epidemic spreading across Europe. The euro crisis has also been prompting some of the globetrotters in Bali to ...</p>

        <p>SPAIN paid almost 7% for 10-year money in a bond auction today, well above the level prevailing in the secondary market (6.43% last night, according to the FT). That gap may reflect the impact of ECB buying (the bank only buys in the secondary market). The sharp rise in yields may reflect the bad economic news (Spain's GDP stagnated in the third quarter and is now expected to grow just 0.8% next year) but it may also reflect uncertainty ahead of Sunday's election, given that the likely PM, Mariano Rajoy, has been rather vague about his programme.You might think that high yields in the peripheral euro zone countries would attract bargain hunters but it doesn't seem to be the case. Cesar Perez of JP Morgan Private bank (himself a Spaniard) gave me a clue earlier this week; fund managers he talked to were unwilling to buy peripheral bonds of yields or 7-8% but they would buy at 4-5% The reason for this paradox is that, at yields of 7-8%, the finances of Spain and Italy look unsustainable (the same would be true of most developed countries). A fall in yields to 4-5% would, in contrast, be a sign that the crisis was over and an indication that both countries could get their fiscal houses in order.</p>

        <p>ED MILIBAND, leader of the opposition Labour Party, gave a very bad speech about Britain's economic situation today. It was so bad, indeed so self-defeatingly bad, that (at the risk of sounding rather parochial and hard-hearted) it sparks wider questions about the political consequences in Britain should recession lurch into full-blown economic catastrophe.Speaking a few days ahead of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's autumn statement, Mr Miliband seized the chance to tell voters that Labour had been proved right about the government's austerity policies. We told you that the Conservative-led coalition was cutting spending too far and too fast, he said, and now we can see that "the biggest economic gamble in a generation has failed."Mr Miliband went into considerable detail. His claims are worth quoting at some length:The August 2010 Bloomberg speech given by Ed Balls, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, has turned out to be extremely prescient...Seventeen months ago George Osborne delivered his Emergency Budget. He did so against the backdrop of an economy emerging from a recession caused by the global financial crisis. There was momentum in the recovery, with growth reaching 1.1% in the second quarter of 2010. Unemployment remained a major concern, but it had started to fall. There was a large budget deficit that had to be brought down and difficult decisions that had to be made. ...</p>

    Is the lady for turning?
    
  
AS A schoolgirl, Angela Merkel spent an entire swimming lesson perched on a diving board. Only when the final bell sounded did she find the nerve to take the plunge. “I am not spontaneously courageous,” the German chancellor later said. “I am, I think, courageous at the right moment,” but “led too much by my head” to leap recklessly in. For Margaret Heckel, author of a book about Mrs Merkel, the story shows that “she goes to her limits and then overcomes them.” She has a “very fundamental confidence in her abilities.”
It is not widely shared. Mrs Merkel’s critics say she has reacted too little and too late to the euro crisis, which now threatens to ...</p>

FIRST Greece; then Ireland and Portugal; then Italy and Spain. Month by month, the crisis in the euro area has crept from the vulnerable periphery of the currency zone towards its core, helped by denial, misdiagnosis and procrastination by the euro-zone’s policymakers. Recently Belgian and French government bonds have been in the financial markets’ bad books. Investors are even sniffy about German bonds: an auction of ten-year Bunds on November 23rd shifted only €3.6 billion-worth ($4.8 billion) of the €6 billion-worth on offer.
Worse, there are signs that the euro zone’s economy is heading for recession, if it is not there already. Industrial orders in the euro zone fell by 6.4% in September, the ...</p>

  SIR – It is not Europe but Britain that needs to wake up to the euro crisis (Special report on Europe and its currency, November 12th). Britain is sleepwalking into irrelevance. Britain’s national interest in relation to Europe and the wider world would be better served if it fought to create a reformed euro-currency block, and then joined it. In fact, you cannot do the one without committing to the other. Protecting London’s future as a financial centre; reforming the common agricultural policy; ensuring that Britain is at the table for future big European technology projects; broking a solution to the current crisis that might actually work; implementing the Lisbon agenda—the list of important issues for Britain goes on.
Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy finally told the Greeks the hard truth: you can’t have the benefits without contributing to the main. It is in Britain’s ...</p>

        <p>THE short-term outlook for the world economy seems to hinge on whether a resolution to Europe's debt crisis can be found. A resolution, in turn, will be difficult to come by if the euro zone falls back into recession. If output is shrinking and unemployment rising, then austerity measures are likely to make economic conditions worse while raising very little new revenue. The euro zone is likely to fall ever deeper into a hole.That's an unnerving possibility given the outlook for the euro-zone economy. Growth in the fourth quarter is likely to be contractionary, according to an analysis of recent data points by Now-Casting, which publishes "real-time" economic forecasts. You can see the information that goes into their forecast in the interactive chart below. A negative fourth quarter has been a real possibility since July, but as recently as early October the economy appeared to be moderating. Since then, the outlook has quickly deteriorated thanks, mostly, to bad news from the core. Falling industrial orders in Germany is among the most worrisome signs, as are big declines in manufacturing purchasing manager's indexes, particularly a big drop in Italy.About this chart: The chart shows an evolving prediction—or "now-cast"—of quarter-on-quarter GDP growth. Now-casts are calculated by a statistical model which draws on a wide range of inputs, including both hard and soft ...</p>

        <p>IT HAS become the worst fear of politicians in America and Europe: after the immediate crisis passes, the developed world will settle into a lost decade (or more) of low growth and deflation, just like Japan. Japan is used as a cautionary tale of ineffective and/or inept economic policy, which failed to revive its economy after a bad recession. But as my colleague points out and as an article from our print edition this week suggests, there’s not much more that short-term fiscal and monetary policy could have done. A large share of Japan’s woes can be blamed on its aging population. In aggregate, Japan’s economy grew at half the pace of America’s between 2001 and 2010. Yet if judged by growth in GDP per person over the same period, then Japan has outperformed America and the euro zone (see chart 1). In part this is because its population has shrunk whereas America’s population has increased.Though growth in labour productivity fell slightly short of America’s from 2000 to 2008, total factor productivity, a measure of how a country uses capital and labour, grew faster, according to the Tokyo-based Asian Productivity Organisation. Japan’s unemployment rate is higher than in 2000, yet it remains about half the level of America and Europe. Anemic Japanese growth rates resulted from having fewer young, productive workers, and from the redirection of an increasing share of ...</p>

        <p>ANOTHER Monday, and the crisis in Europe continues to build. Euro-zone governments continue to tumble; Spain forcefully ejected its Socialist government on Sunday. Its recent rule coincided with economic collapse, rising unemployment, and round after round of austerity, as the government sought to get ahead of the debt crisis. The new government's large majority will give it more room to manage an unmanageable crisis. Spanish yields are rising today, along with those of Italy. The crisis is beyond the power of individual governments to solve on their own; coordination is key.Which makes one piece of news out of Brussels today seem at least somewhat auspicious. The European Commission has put together a white paper, to be released this week, proposing the creation of euro bonds. It appears that three different options are discussed, moving along the spectrum of shared risk. In those least ambitious version, the combined governments of the euro zone would provide some guarantee for the newly issued bonds of national governments. In the most ambitious scheme, the euro zone would approve individual budgets, which would be financed through euro bonds. The paper is best understood as just another step forward in the long process of tighter fiscal integration within the euro zone. The problem, of course, is that Europe wouldn't appear to have that much time to put together ...</p>

        <p>THE theory behind the supercommittee was that it would be a superconducting committee, eliminating the frictions caused by hundreds of clashing representatives in the House and Senate and zooming everyone straight along into a $1.2 trillion deficit-reduction agreement. Instead, it seems to have become a supercolliding committee, focusing the two parties down into a narrower space so that the impact blasts everything into tiny subatomic particles.The two sides are now close to conceding that the effort has failed, largely due to a fundamental disagreement over the question of whether rich people should pay more in taxes. The Republicans' latest full-scale plan would've raised the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, cut Social Security benefits, and cut income taxes for all households. Under the plan, the top marginal tax rate would fall from 35% to 28%. According to the New York Times, to make up for the tax cuts, "Republicans would curb $3.5 trillion dollars’ worth of tax breaks, items like credits and exemptions for retirement savings, child care and dependents. (The plan does not specify which ones would be cut.)"That last sentence is priceless. Meanwhile the Republicans made a scaled-down last-ditch offer on Friday that only comes up with $643 billion in deficit reduction, thus leading to a presumed $557 billion in "trigger" cuts balanced between defence and ...</p>

        <p>THE DAILY Mail carries a cartoon of Angela Merkel this morning sporting a Hitler moustache, jackboots, riding breeches and doing the Nazi salute. It is all a terrific joke, apparently, a parody of the Mel Brooks comedy "Springtime for Hitler" (adapted by the Mail to add such chortling touches as a "Greek President Stavros" character, David Cameron as Neville Chamberlain and Nick Clegg as a Hitler youth). This follows columns by the Mail's chief political thinker, Simon Heffer, accusing Germany of trying to found a "Fourth Reich." Over at ConservativeHome, a website not known for slavish pro-Europeanism, a sighing Tim Montgomerie asks: "Can we talk about Germany without resorting to WWII imagery?"I suspect that is another of John Rentoul's "Questions to which the answer is no." For what it is worth, I idly wonder whether some deep-seated psychological complex is playing out at Northcliffe House, Kensington headquarters of the Mail empire. Perhaps the tabloid feels bound to denounce the Fourth Reich because—for much of the 1930s—it so enthusiastically supported the Third Reich? Who can forget the July 1933 "Youth Triumphant" leader in praise of Nazism by the paper's owner Lord Rothermere, informing British readers that before Herr Hitler took over, "Israelites of international attachments were insinuating themselves into key positions in the German administrative machine"?

WHEN HILDA SOLIS was at high school, a male career adviser told her mother that the girl was not college material; she should consider becoming a secretary. Hilda was furious. One of seven children born to working-class immigrant parents, she had high ambitions. She did go to college, became a lawmaker in California and is now secretary of labour, the first Latina to hold a cabinet post in America’s federal government.
On Tarja Halonen’s first day at work in the legal department of a trade union she answered the phone to a man who, hearing a female voice, asked to speak to one of the lawyers. She informed him that he was speaking to one. Things got better after that. Following her stint as a lawyer she served in Finland’s parliament for over 20 years. Since 2000 she has been the country’s president, the first female in the job.

        <p>MY COLLEAGUE writes that the European Central Bank's bond-market tactics—choosing to intervene in markets on some occasions and not on others—are proving useful:It is understandable that the ECB does not want to back countries like Italy in an unlimited way because there is no reason to trust that any one country won’t free-ride on ECB liquidity—a risk that other central banks don't face. Critics of the ECB have to reconcile their view with the fact that market pressure led to some very important changes and reforms that political pressure could not accomplish.The Peterson Institute's Jacob Funk Kirkegaard expresses a similar view:[O]nly after Italian 10-year interest rates went past the 7 percent “nuclear threshold” did financial demands bring about a new government in Rome.1 Thus has “regime change” installing new technocratic-led governments occurred in two democratic states, resulting from financial market pressure unchecked by the ECB...It is now clear that the ECB under the new presidency of Mario Draghi, the former governor of the Bank of Italy, has been vindicated in its strategy of refusing to defend Italian bond spreads around the 400–450 basis points, thereby forcing Italy to implement the reforms the central bank sought in August. In the end, it was the Italian political class that blinked first in this latest game of chicken and pushed Berlusconi out.If there ...</p>

THE Japanese say they suffer from an economic disease called “structural pessimism”. Overseas too, there is a tendency to see Japan as a harbinger of all that is doomed in the economies of the euro zone and America—even though figures released on November 14th show its economy grew by an annualised 6% in the third quarter, rebounding quickly from the March tsunami and nuclear disaster.
Look dispassionately at Japan’s economic performance over the past ten years, though, and “the second lost decade”, if not the first, is a misnomer. Much of what tarnishes Japan’s image is the result of demography—more ...</p>
