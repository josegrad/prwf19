        <p>THE judgment of the big credit rating agencies may not carry quite the thunderous resonance it used to, but the steady drumbeat of rich sovereign downgrades nonetheless provides an unpleasant crisis rhythm. On Tuesday, Moody's became the latest agency to revise downward its view of the solidity of European sovereigns. The ratings firm passed out a handful of downgrades—to Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain—which, while unfortunate, left those countries still hanging on to "investment grade" ratings (all but Portugal) out of "speculative" territory. Moody's left the outlook on those sovereigns negative, suggesting a 30% chance of another downgrade in the next 18 months. Three other sovereigns—Austria, France, and Britain—were spared a downgrade but had their outlooks moved to negative.One theme featured again and again in Moody's discussion of the changes, which it blamed on:The uncertainty over the prospects for institutional reform in the euro area and the weak macroeconomic outlook across the region, which will continue to weigh on already fragile market confidence.Moody's stated repeatedly that the prospects for real institutional reform within the euro zone are dubious, and it isn't clear that euro-zone sovereigns will pony up sufficient funds to deal with the ongoing crisis. In addition, there is concern about the deteriorating euro-zone economy, ...</p>

        <p>The cost of living across the globe ZURICH has become the world’s most expensive city to live in, according to the latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister company. The strengthening of the Swiss franc in the past year helped lift the city four places up the table to displace Tokyo at the top. The index measures the cost of an expatriate lifestyle in over 130 cities using a weighted average of the prices of 160 products and services. New York's figure is set to 100 to provide a base for comparisons. The relative strengths of currencies and economies are reflected in changes to the rankings. Thus Sydney has moved from 71st to 7th since 2001, while New York has fallen from 7th to joint 47th. </p>

        <p>IN 2000, the Bureau of Labour Statistics introduced the Job Openings and Labour Turnover Survey, a data series that added to existing figures on payroll employment and household unemployment with details on the number of job openings, hires, and job separations in the economy. This series gave economists a new and interesting look into the dynamics of business cycles during one of the deepest downturns of the century. And that, in turn, is generating a new understanding of what happens when an economy enters recession and how such times differ from the normal, healthy operation of the labour market.One thing that has clearly emerged is that net changes in employment are small relative to the gross flows through the labour market. Millions of workers move from job-to-job every quarter, in a process economists call churn. This week's Free exchange column examines how churn changed during the Great Recession and what that change has meant for the broader economy:Just 9m workers were hired in the second quarter of 2009—the last of the recession—down from 12.8m in the fourth quarter of 2007, a fall of about 30%. About 80% of this decline in hiring was attributable to a fall in churn rather than a decline in job creation (see left-hand chart). The number of workers voluntarily leaving a job fell by nearly 40%, for instance. The pace of job creation in the economy slowed sharply, ...</p>

TRYING to coerce a group of sovereign states to follow common rules is ultimately doomed. Leagues and confederacies are like feudal baronies: breaches lead to anarchy, tyranny and war. That was Alexander Hamilton’s case for a strong American federal government. After the adoption of America’s constitution, Hamilton became treasury secretary. The federal government assumed the war debts of the ex-colonies, issued new national bonds backed by direct taxes and minted its own currency. Hamilton’s new financial system helped transform the young republic from a basket-case into an economic powerhouse.
Does Europe, in its chronic financial crisis, need such a “Hamiltonian moment”? The European elite is looking across the Atlantic for ideas. There is little danger, as Hamilton put it in the ...</p>

WHEN the winning bid for the privatisation of Guarulhos, São Paulo’s main international airport, was read out on February 6th, the crowd at the city’s stock exchange gasped. At 16.2 billion reais ($9.4 billion), it was nearly 4 billion reais more than the second-highest bid, and 12.8 billion reais above the government-specified minimum. On offer was 51% of a public-private partnership with Infraero, Brazil’s lumbering state-owned operator. The partnership will have to pay the sum in inflation-linked instalments over 20 years, and also give the government 10% of its turnover. From what is left, money will have to be found for investment of more than 4.5 billion reais fixing up decrepit, overcrowded terminals. A third of that sum must be spent before hordes of football fans arrive for the 2014 World Cup.

                    The number of job-to-job moves by American workers tells a bleak story        
        

FIGURES on employment tend to encourage a black-or-white view of an economy. Either conditions are worsening and firms are shedding workers, as they did by the hundreds of thousands in 2008 and 2009, or times are improving and businesses are creating new jobs. Spirits leapt on February 3rd on news that America’s private businesses boosted their payrolls by 257,000 jobs in January, capping the country’s best 12-month employment performance in the private sector for over five years. But the headline figures represent just the tip of a large labour-market iceberg. Data provided by the relatively new Jobs Openings and Labour Turnover Survey (JOLTS) illuminate these depths.
Even in the darkest of days, labour markets remain busy. Growing firms hire to expand and even shrinking businesses seek out workers to fill important vacant positions. In December 2008, for instance, overall American employment dropped by ...</p>

        <p>RIGHT now, an awful lot of very smart people are looking at Europe, scratching their heads, and wondering two things:1) Is it possible that the euro zone has actually figured out a way to muddle through this mess?2) Did they somehow do all the things I said they needed to do without me noticing?I don't know whether the euro zone has figured out a way to muddle through this mess. It seems pretty clear to me that the euro zone has not done the things I thought it needed to do to make it through, but at the moment it isn't that easy to figure out what the ECB's actual underlying strategy is. Perhaps time will vindicate me in every way; so I say to myself every morning. My feeling is that the crisis is about the fear that institutions will be unable to make good on their obligations, that failure to make good on these obligations will cause significant financial and economic disruption, and that the only way to solve the problem is to figure out how to handle a potential shortfall in a manner that's as minimally disruptive as possible—perhaps through inflation and/or financial repression.I don't know if that's wrong or not. What seems somewhat clearer now is that a lot can happen if one manages to avoid a sudden meltdown. The channel through which that meltdown would occur would almost surely be the banking system. And the ECB seems to have closed off that risk for now by ...</p>

        <p>Volker Wieland is Professor of Monetary Theory and Policy at Goethe University of Frankfurt since 2000 and a Founding Professor of the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability. Prior to joining the Frankfurt faculty he was a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, DC.ON JANUARY 25th, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to keep the federal funds rate at 0% to 0.25% and said that economic conditions are likely to warrant such low levels at least through late 2014. Many observers were surprised by such a long-term commitment to low rates.  Interestingly, however, historical estimates of funds-rate reactions to FOMC members’ forecasts prescribe just such a response to the forecast published on January 25th.Historically, FOMC funds-rate decisions are closely matched by a simple rule of thumb that includes the mid-points of the inflation and unemployment forecasts reported by FOMC members. This finding was reported in an article in the Federal Reserve of St. Louis Review in 2008 by Athanasios Orphanides and Volker Wieland, but goes back to their earlier unpublished work with David Lindsey at the Federal Reserve in 1997.  Figure 1 shows the prescriptions from this rule of thumb together with a second version that includes interest-rate smoothing. The rule with smoothing partially adjusts to the funds rate set at the policy meeting when the ...</p>

        <p>LAST fall, euro-zone banks and euro-zone sovereigns were locked in a vicious circle that seemed doomed to end in tragedy. As doubts about sovereign solvency grew, banks found it increasingly difficult to fund themselves and a major liquidity crisis threatened. And as banks teetered, the sovereigns that would have found themselves on the hook for resulting bail-outs watched their borrowing costs soar still higher. Only the power of the printing press seemed up to the task of salvaging the situation, and many observers, including The Economist, urged the European Central Bank to backstop the sovereign debt of troubled member countries.As is its wont, the ECB followed a different strategy, as this week's Free exchange column explains:When in 2009 the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England slashed interest rates towards zero and started quantitative easing (buying government bonds with central-bank money), the ECB was more circumspect. It was reluctant to cut its main rate below 1% and loth to buy government bonds directly.Instead it adopted its own non-standard measures. It offered unlimited loans to commercial banks for up to a year against a broad range of collateral. The ECB’s oblique approach had much the same effect as the route taken by the Fed and others. A flood of liquidity from a €442 billion ($611 billion) auction of one-year ECB loans in June 2009 pushed ...</p>

        <p>OVER at Democracy in America, my colleague summarises a number of recent debates about "fiscal stimulus" in a way that usefully illustrates the...confused nature of the discussion. Fiscal policy has been an intensely political subject over the last few years, and that, I think, has made it very difficult to figure out what, at any given time, people are arguing about. I think Tyler Cowen often overstates the utility of generosity toward one's opponents in a debate, but in this case he has a point—participants often seem more interested in winning an exchange than in working to clarify exactly what the disagreement is about in the first place.In fact, there have been several different arguments taking place since the beginning of the recession. They often run together but are worth thinking about discretely. (I may miss a few.)1) What is the appropriate time frame over which to balance government budgets? Other things equal, a government will suffer a deterioration in its budget balance when the economy weakens. Tax revenues decline, and social spending will often increase. Allowing the government to balance its budget over the business cycle—and therefore to run deficits during recessions—provides automatic stabilisation to the economy, the more so when governments have put in place generous, specific automatic stabilisers like unemployment insurance. By contrast, ...</p>

        <p>BEFORE his big speech last week, liberals advised Barack Obama to stay away from arguing about the merits of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ie, the stimulus bill of 2009). While independent economists generally agree that the stimulus saved or created somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2m jobs, it remains unpopular with the general public; the sense was that there was no point engaging on this issue, regardless of the merits. Now ProPublica's Mike Grabell is out with a book-length investigation of the stimulus, titled "Money Well Spent?"In an interview last week on NPR's Fresh Air, Mr Grabell said the stimulus effort had its good points and its bad points. On the one hand, money funneled to states to forestall budget cuts saved huge numbers of jobs for teachers, firefighters and other employees, and delayed cutbacks in infrastructure spending. He subscribes to the general wisdom that unemployment probably would have hit 12% in 2009 rather than 10% without it. On the other hand, the administration had to drop an idea that almost certainly would have made sense—building a national electric smart grid—because the jurisdictional and red-tape problems made it impossible to implement fast enough. Instead the administration decided to invest in clean energy; but those investments placed their bets too heavily on individual companies, some of which then went ...</p>

        <p>   BY THE standards of past summits, European leaders finished early—shortly before 10pm on January 30th. And by the acrimonious standards of past gatherings, notably last month’s bust-up with Britain, this event was uneventful, even amicable. Agreement was reached on the fiscal compact, the new treaty to toughen budget rules, in record time: less than two months.A final row between France and Poland over who gets to attend which summits was resolved with a complicated compromise. This involves variable configurations of meetings involving 17 countries (the euro zone), 23 (the largely-forgotten Euro-Plus Pact, 25 (the signatories of the fiscal compact), 27 (all EU member states, still in charge of the single market) and 28 (involving soon-to-join Croatia). It shows that, at the very least, European leaders can negotiate rapidly when they have the political will to do so—and when the British and the Czechs decide to step aside. Whether electorates will be quite so quick to shackle themselves to Germanic fiscal rules is another matter. But did the leaders achieve anything useful to stem the crisis in the latest of their interminable summits? Their compact—now called the “treaty on stability, co-ordination and governance in the Economic and Monetary Union”, has as its main aim the imposition of balanced-budget rules on members. This may be a useful discipline in good times. ...</p>

        <p>I'D LIKE to express a bit of disagreement with my colleague's assessment of the European Central Bank's recent behaviour. He writes:The focus on events in Greece meant there was a bit less attention on the ECB’s main business of monetary policy. The bank decided to keep its main interest rate at 1% at the monetary-policy meeting that finished an hour of so before Mr Draghi spoke. Earlier in the day, the Bank of England had, as widely expected, increased the target for its asset-purchase (or “quantitative easing”) programme by £50 billion, to £325 billion. A statement by the bank’s monetary-policy committee said additional bond purchases were needed to address the immediate weakness in the economy, which meant inflation would otherwise fall below its 2% target in the medium term.The ECB is squeamish about the sort of quantitative easing the Bank of England has gone in for. Yet its monetary policy is liberal all the same. Mr Draghi said the three-year long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) scheduled for February 29th was likely to be as big as the first one in December, at which €489 billion of three-year loans were advanced to euro-zone banks. The ECB’s 23-strong governing council has only just set the terms by which banks can pledge “credit claims” (ie, unsecured bank loans) as collateral for ECB money, including at theupcoming LTRO. Mr Draghi reckons this will be ...</p>

        <p>GREECE was the word on everyone’s mind as Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), sat down to his regular monthly press conference on February 9th. Mr Draghi was quick to say he had only just taken a telephone call from Lucas Papademos, Greece’s interim prime minister, who confirmed that an agreement had been struck on a new bail-out package for his beleaguered country. The ECB (though not a party to negotiations) had also picked up “vibrations” that suggested Greece was close to a deal with its private-sector creditors, too. Further details are likely to emerge after a meeting of the euro-zone finance ministers later today.</p>

IN MORE ways than one, things are hotting up at Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO), which runs the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant crippled by an earthquake and tsunami last March 11th. In recent days temperatures in one of the plant’s reactors may have hovered too close for comfort to the level where a chain-reaction might reoccur from melted fuel. Since February 7th TEPCO has been pouring in 14 tonnes of water an hour in the hopes of keeping things cool. It is an uneasy reminder for ordinary Japanese that nearly a year after the disaster the reactors are not yet stable.
Back in Tokyo, TEPCO faces more hot water. The government is laying plans to nationalise the troubled utility, overhaul its ...</p>

THE true extent of Africa’s vast wealth of resources is hard to guess. Geologists have picked over most of the rest of the globe in search of minerals, yet huge swathes of Africa remain largely unprobed. But the immense ore deposits so far discovered and soaring commodity prices on the back of rip-roaring Chinese demand have convinced the world’s miners that the continent is the next big frontier. Bumper profits have also spurred mineral-rich countries to seek a bigger share of the spoils.
The list of African governments that have miners in their sights is a long one. South Africa, home to the greatest mineral wealth in the world, estimated to be worth $2.5 ...</p>

        <p>ANYONE who takes financial-market indicators as a guide to the real world must be mad or a banker. But it is still interesting to note, as Bloomberg has just calculated, that on risk-adjusted returns Polish government bonds are a better bet than either German bunds or US Treasuries. The Bloomberg ranking gives Poland the top spot with an 8.3% return in local currency in the three years to February 6th, against 4% for German government debt and 3% for the US paper. Polish debt was only ninth in total returns, but shot up the index because of its lower volatility.  That is better news for lenders than taxpayers: Polish borrowing costs are still quite high by international standards, at around 6%. But it is a feather in the cap for Poland's finance minister, Jan Rostowski, who has piloted the country almost unscathed through the economic storms in the euro zone.   Poland is striving to get the budget deficit below 3% of GDP this year, which is a condition of eligibility for euro zone entry in 2015. However Mr Rostowski is backing away from that target: he told the BBC that Poland would join the common currency "only when it is safe to do so".Along with AA- credit ratings for Estonia and the Czech Republic (better than Italy's), the Bloomberg calculations help highlight the relative economic strength of countries that were once part of the continent's "east ...</p>

        <p>CITI economists Willem Buiter and Ebrahim Rahbari write:First, we raise our estimate of the likelihood of Greek exit from the eurozone (or ‘Grexit’) to 50% over the next 18 months from earlier estimates of ours which put it at 25-30%. Second, we argue that the implications of Grexit for the rest of the EA and the world would be negative, but moderate, as exit fear contagion would likely be contained by policy action, notably from the ECB.Not "Grout"? Exposure to Greece among European financial institutions was always relatively small given the relatively small size of the country. Banks have been working furiously to reduce even that, and with the European Central Bank now directing a flood of money toward euro-area banks it looks, to these fellows at least, as if the economic and financial risks of a Greek departure are mostly contained. As this paper acknowledged recently, the cost of a Greek exit to the broader euro zone is falling:For the rest of Europe, a Greek exit would also be dangerous: it could cause bank runs, capital flight and soaring bond yields in Portugal, Italy and beyond. But over time the balance of risks will change. Once a tough debt restructuring has been imposed on Greece’s private creditors, the country’s fate will have less impact on other bond markets. As reforms in Italy and Spain gain momentum, the distinctions between Greece and others will ...</p>

        <p>AIRPORT traffic in Europe grew 7.3% in 2011, according to new figures from the Airports Council International (ACI). Having said that, it makes more sense to compare 2011’s traffic with a 2010 figure that does not include the traffic-reducing effect of the volcanic ash cloud. In this scenario the increase in traffic in 2011 is only 5.2%.Traffic grew more strongly in airports outside the European Union than those inside (12.2% v 6.3%). The slowdown in the euro zone was partly to blame for this discrepancy. For example, Athens saw the greatest drop in passenger numbers (-6.3%) out of the continent's 50 biggest airports, and—more alarmingly—its traffic dropped 10% year-on-year in December 2011.Problems in the euro zone explain why Olivier Jankovec, the director general of ACI Europe, expects the region's traffic to be less impressive in 2012 than in 2011.The odds are that 2012 will be a different story. Economies have come to a stand-still in many parts of Europe with the sovereign debt crisis, which is also having a ripple effect on growth prospects elsewhere. This will affect demand for air transport. At the same time, fuel costs and national aviation taxes are going to limit airlines ’ willingness to add capacity – a serious concern, especially for regional airports.Heathrow remains the biggest airport in Europe, with over 69m passengers passing through in 2011.

        <p>A SHARP point from the monthly note of the Bank Credit Analyst (always one of the best research reads). The writers agree that the ECB's LTRO loans have stopped the possibility of a dangerous bank run in the euro zone. To have confidence in money, citizens need to be reassured that the government stands behind the banks. Butsuch a backstop can only be credible if there are no doubts about the government's solvency. The problem in Europe is that deposit insurance schemes are administered at the national level. That is where the ECB comes in. While it would never admit it, through a rather circuitous route. the ECB has now assumed a role comparable to the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)It's understandable in the circumstances but not what those who set up the ECB had in mind.</p>

        <p>NOTHING in my life has made me as pessimistic about development aid as the course of the American intervention in Afghanistan. The New York Times' Graham Bowley reports that unsurprisingly, the country is set to drop into a drastic recession as foreign aid dries up over the next few years. That's because foreign aid amounted to 97% of the economy in 2010, and will largely disappear by 2018.Already, the housing bubble is deflating. A typical house normally costs $30,000 to $230,000 depending on size and location, but deals dried up and prices dropped by $10,000 to $50,000 last year as people worried about the pullout, though prices bounced back in December, Mr. Babakarkhail said.The same tremors are being felt about 20 miles away on the icy hills north of Kabul, where Miraj Din, 48, who used to deliver food and firewood in a wheelbarrow, now manages Mumtaz’s Car Salesroom, selling imported cars to the country’s elite.  Last year, he sold about a dozen cars a month, but this year he is selling only one car a month as Afghans with enough money to buy these fancy vehicles delay their purchases or move their money abroad, he said.I think I've seen figures showing that foreign aid was actually greater than the country's entire GDP in 2011. That sounds impossible, but I'd imagine it reflects the fact that foreign aid is often spent on salaries for Western consultants and equipment ...</p>

        <p>LAST fall, as the crisis in the euro zone threatened to spin out of control, clouds darkened across the global economy. Globally, industrial production began contracting for a brief period and concern grew that a major European financial crisis would sink the world back into recession. Then, the European Central Bank stepped in with massive, long-term lending to banks, and threat of an immediate meltdown nearly vanished. In the relative calm generated by the ECB's intervention, activity stabilised and is now rising again in many cases, according to the latest industrial production figures from around the world.Globally, production accelerated from December to January, though it remains only barely in expansionary territory at 51.2. Around the world, conditions remain mixed. Activity in China stayed in contractionary territory, as its export outlook weakened. India's economy, on the other hand, which had lots of observers nervous late last year as capital flooded out of the country, showed the strongest manufacturing growth in 8 months, and a big acceleration from December. Activity in Britain swung from shrinking to growing in January, and American manufacturing growth quickened, as well. Recovery still looks dicey, but after last year's stumble the early-2012 jump is encouraging.Europe, however, remains a mess. Manufacturing activity in the euro zone fell again in January. ...</p>

        <p>CHARLEMAGNE files a dispatch from the latest EU summit:Their compact—now called the “treaty on stability, co-ordination and governance in the Economic and Monetary Union”, has as its main aim the imposition of balanced-budget rules on members. This may be a useful discipline in good times. But many worry that, at a time of widespread crisis, such pro-cyclical rules risk imposing too much austerity too widely, thus darkening the spectre of recession and making it even harder to balance budgets. This may explain why leaders suddenly want to be seen talking about their plan (declaration is here in PDF) for growth and jobs, particularly in tackling the problem of youth unemployment.Nevertheless, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor who had pushed hard for the treaty, hailed it as a great success. Many others, however, dismiss the compact with so much faint praise. “It is an important distraction”, says one diplomat. “It has gone from damaging to merely useless,” says a member of the European Parliament. Even Mario Monti, these days everybody’s favourite Italian, judged the compact little more than “a decorative songbird”.Set aside, for the moment, are decisions about just what to do with Greece and how best to boost the euro zone's "firewall" fund—the financial money pot needed to fend off attacks on troubled banks and sovereigns. On the latter score, there have been calls to ...</p>
